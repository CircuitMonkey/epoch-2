Epoch Vibrator Controller 2 - Now with 100% more edge...

## Description
A follow on to [Epoch 1](https://github.com/CircuitMonkey/epoch).  Redesigned with [AdaFruit Qualia ESP32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5800) and a [4-inch IPS touch display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5826) or [Amazon 4-inch IPS (GT911 touch)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9H3HWR3).  Motors driven with [pca9685 PWM controller](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-16-channel-pwm-servo-hat-for-raspberry-pi)/[Amazon PCA9685 Board](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D73811V8) and FET outputs in order to drive bigger motors.  Epoch 1 was limited to 120mA maximum motor drive (because of PWM controller choice) and some larger "rumble" motors need 180mA or higher.
